Cyclistic  is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations in Chicago, Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day. They offer single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.

The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the main question this project seeks to answer is: 

❔ How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

The database used was from every ride of 2023, available on this link ➡️  https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

In order to obtain insights the following actions and calculations were made in Microsoft Excel:

✔️ Removing duplicates

✔️ Removing rows with wrong dates

✔️ Creating the column 'day_of_week'

✔️ Creating the column 'ride_length'

✔️ Creating a Pivot Table with the averages ride_length of members and casual riders per day of the week

✔️ Max, Min, Mode of each month

✔️  Bar graph from the pivot
